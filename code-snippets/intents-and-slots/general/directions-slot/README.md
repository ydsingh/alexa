# Characters Slot Type

Sometimes a customer needs to say letters, numbers or other characters to input a code (e.g. tracking number). This slot type helps when those values are individual characters instead of words.

We strongly recommend that you use the slot type name of **COOKBOOK_CharactersSlotType** so that you know that you based the slot type on content from the Alexa Cookbook and can return here to refresh/update your slot type with any newly added utterances.

## List of Utterances
Use these values if your tool uses a simple list as the input mechanism (e.g. developer console’s [Bulk Edit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html#edit-or-upload-sample-utterances-in-bulk)).

> Note: the slot type values are comma separated in this order: value, id, synonym1, synonym2, ...
