# Installation Instructions

2. Install the Alexa Design System Library plugin [here](sketch://add-library/?url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ddg-apl-library/Alexa-Design-System-Library-appcast.xml). Clicking this link will automatically start the download to Sketch. Anytime the library is updated, you'll automatically be updated as well so you’ll always have the most recent version.
