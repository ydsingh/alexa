# Situational Design

Situational Design is a frame-based (vs. graph-based) methodology for creating voice designs for skills. Frame-based designs permit flexible interaction models that don't require complex and fragile flow logic.

Once you've determined what kind of skill you want to build and have scripted out a few scenarios, it's time to create your design artifact. Each script outlines a set of *turns*. Each turn starts with: the user's utterance, the situation, changes to the context, Alexa's response and prompt.

## Situational Design Templates

For designing your storyboard, we've made our templates in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), a free design tool. PDF copies are also available of the template materials.

In the [Quick Start XD](./quick-start.xd) file ([PDF version](./quick-start.pdf)), the top of the canvas has a few templates you can use to start your storyboards. We've included:
1. A Dialog Worksheet, which can be printed out from the PDF provided.
1. Large turn template: incorporating the turn card, development notes, APL canvases, and note area.
1. Medium turn template: incorporating the turn card and development notes.
1. Turn template: provides the turn only, but can be expanded into the large turn template if you need it.
1. Intent Definition: A notepad to identify intents, utterances, slots, and dynamic entities.

In the XD file, below the templates, use the Scenario rows to construct your own storyboards. Just copy a template, paste it in the Scenario of your choice, and fill in the template with your skill content. Storyboards are a linear representation of the conversation in time.

In the XD file, to the right of the templates and scenarios is the grid. This is a way to keep track of all of your cards that could appear in your skill, regardless of time. Each column has its own topic and each row has a number. For each card, fill out the Topic and Cell number to keep track of your content in your skill. When you think of a new variation, add it to the next row in the appropriate topic row to keep track of it, even if you don't use it in a storyboard.
